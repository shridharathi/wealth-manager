Many investors turn to mutual funds to meet their long-term financial goals. They offer the benefits of
diversification and professional management, and are seen as an easy and efficient way to invest.
However, as with all investment choices, investing in mutual funds involves risks. Helping you to understand
these risks, and how to choose the funds that are in line with your own personal goals, is one of the many
services your Financial Advisor can provide.
If you have questions about mutual funds, or any investment, please contact your Financial Advisor.
Helping you reach
your financial goals
Millions of investors find mutual funds the right solution for their long-term financial goals. Some reasons include:
PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT The fund’s portfolio is
professionally managed by experienced money managers who
research and select investments that are appropriate for the fund’s
objective, and provide full-time monitoring of the performance of
those investments. If changes are necessary, they’re able to modify
the fund’s holdings.
DIVERSIFICATION The concept of diversification is as simple as
the time-tested advice, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” By
spreading your investments across a wide range of companies and
industry sectors, you can better protect your assets during market
fluctuations. Mutual fund ownership makes it easy for an investor to
maintain a diversified investment portfolio.
AFFORDABILITY To invest in a diversified portfolio of individual
securities would require a large investment. Many mutual funds allow
investors to purchase shares for a relatively low dollar amount for
initial and subsequent purchases.
LIQUIDITY Investors may redeem their mutual fund shares for any
reason at the current net asset value (NAV), plus any fees and charges
assessed on redemption.
DIVIDEND PAYMENTS A fund can earn income in the form of
dividends and interest on the securities in its portfolio, which is
passed on to shareholders in the form of dividends.
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT You can set up your account for
the automatic reinvestment of any dividends generated by your
fund, allowing you to accumulate more shares without incurring a
sales charge.
CAPITAL GAINS DISTRIBUTION Occurs when the fund sells a
security that has increased in value. At the end of each year, most
funds will distribute any capital gains (minus any capital losses)
to their investors. You may also elect to have these distributions
reinvested without incurring a sales charge.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives and risks as well as charges and expenses of the mutual fund before investing.
To obtain a prospectus, contact your Financial Advisor or visit the fund company’s website. The prospectus contains this and other information
about the mutual fund. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its affiliates do not offer legal, tax or accounting advice. Clients are urged to consult their own legal, tax and
accounting advisors with respect to their specific situations.
Securities are offered by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS), member FINRA and SIPC. JPMS is an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
IMPORTANT REMINDERS
Mutual funds are not guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.
You can lose money investing in mutual funds.
Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. However,
past performance can help you assess a fund’s volatility over time.
All funds have costs that lower your investment returns.
The mutual funds and share classes available at J.P. Morgan Securities
are limited and will change from time to time. It is important to work
with your Financial Advisor to determine which funds and share
classes are available for purchase in your account.
Before you invest, be sure to read the fund’s prospectus and
shareholder reports to learn about the fund you’re considering. By
clearly understanding the investment you’re considering, you’ll be
better prepared to make a sound investment decision. To obtain a
prospectus, please contact your Financial Advisor.
A mutual fund is an investment company that pools assets from many investors and invests the money in stocks,
bonds and other securities or assets in some combination. The holdings of the mutual fund are its “portfolio.” Each
share of the mutual fund represents an investor’s proportionate ownership of the fund’s holdings and the income
those holdings may generate. Mutual funds also have some unique characteristics that investors need to consider
before making the decision to invest:
COSTS DESPITE NEGATIVE RETURNS Sales charges, annual
fees and other expenses must be paid by the mutual fund investor
regardless of how the fund performs. Investors may also be required
to pay taxes on any capital gains distribution they receive, even if
the fund declines in value after the shares are purchased, or the
shares have been held a relatively short period of time. This is
especially important at the end of the year, when many funds
distribute capital gains.
KNOWLEDGE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS By relying on the fund
managers to manage the fund’s holdings, the individual investors
usually have little current knowledge of the exact makeup of a fund’s
portfolio. Additionally, they have no direct influence on the timing or
selection of securities the fund manager buys or sells.
DEGREES OF RISK All mutual funds carry some degree of risk.
You may lose some or all of the money you invest—your principal—
because the securities held by a fund fluctuate in value on a daily
basis. Any dividends or interest payments may also fluctuate due to
changing market conditions.
BUYING AND SELLING MUTUAL FUNDS Investors may purchase
mutual fund shares in a number of ways. The two most common are
from the fund itself or through a Financial Advisor. The price paid
for mutual fund shares is the fund’s per share net asset value (NAV),
plus any shareholder fees that the fund may impose at the time of
purchase, such as sales loads. The NAV is calculated at the end of
each business day by dividing the total value of the fund’s holdings
(less expenses) by the number of shares owned by the fund’s
shareholders. Investors of mutual funds purchase at the NAV next
calculated after they place their trade order. Mutual fund shares are
“redeemable,” meaning that investors can sell their shares back to
the fund at any time. The portfolios of mutual funds are managed
by separate entities known as “Investment Advisors,” which are
registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Most mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds are designed
for long-term investors, not active traders. Mutual funds strive to
achieve a particular investment objective, such as capital appreciation
or current income, over time. Therefore, they are not designed for
investors seeking quick profits or for those attempting to “time the
market.” Instead, mutual funds may be appropriate for those who
have made a long-term commitment to investing and realize that it
takes time for stocks and bonds to achieve their potential.
MARKET TIMING Most mutual funds implement practices and
procedures that protect shareholders from investors who are active
traders and seek to practice a market timing strategy. Market timing
involves the rapid buying and selling of mutual fund shares in an
attempt to realize short-term profits. This excessive trading of mutual
fund shares may disrupt a fund’s investment strategy. It also may
negatively influence performance results by increasing trading costs
and/or causing fund managers to hold more cash than they otherwise
would prefer to hold. In order to discourage investors from using their
funds to practice market timing, a fund may:
IMPOSE REDEMPTION FEES Some mutual funds charge fees to
investors who redeem their shares within a few months of purchasing
them. Usually, the fund company returns the redemption fees to the
fund’s portfolio to offset the costs associated with short-term trading.
IMPLEMENT TRADING RESTRICTIONS Most funds limit the number
of exchanges (selling shares of one fund and using the proceeds to
purchase shares of another in the same fund family) and “round-trip”
transactions (a purchase followed by a redemption) that shareholders
may make within a specific time period. For example, a fund may limit
shareholders to two substantive exchanges within a 30-day period.
MODIFY EXCHANGE PRIVILEGES Most mutual fund families let
their shareholders exchange shares of one fund they manage for
shares of another fund they manage, with some restrictions. If
this practice results in excessive trading, the fund may modify the
exchange privilege. For example, it may make exchanges into certain
funds effective on a delayed basis in order to disrupt a market
timing strategy.
IDENTIFY AND ISOLATE MARKET TIMERS Some funds attempt to
identify market timers by monitoring shareholder transactions. Upon
identifying market timers, the fund may restrict the timers’ trading
privileges or expel them from the fund.
Investors today have thousands of choices when it comes to investing in mutual funds. Understanding your individual
financial goals and risk tolerance—either on your own or with the help of your Financial Advisor—is the first step in the
journey to reaching your long-term financial goals. This will help you to begin narrowing your choices.
Mutual funds fit into three main categories—money market funds, bond funds, stock funds (also called “equity” funds).
Each category has unique features, risks and rewards. In general, the higher the potential return, the higher the
potential risk of loss. Mutual funds are not FDIC-insured or guaranteed by any governmental agency.
What’s in a name? There are rules requiring a fund to invest at least 80% of its assets in the type of investments
suggested by its name. However, funds can invest up to 20% of their holdings in other types of securities. Always read
the prospectus carefully before investing.
MONEY MARKET FUNDS Typically less volatile than other types of
mutual funds because they invest in high-quality, short-term money
market instruments that are issued and payable in U.S. dollars. A money
market fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. Money
market funds pay dividends that are usually declared daily, paid
monthly, and generally reflect short-term interest rates. “Inflation risk,”
the risk that the inflation rate will grow faster than the investment’s
return over time, can be a concern for money market fund investors.
A money market fund that qualifies as a “government money market
fund” under applicable regulations must invest 99.5% of its assets
in cash, government securities and/or repurchase agreements
that are backed by cash and government securities. Other types of
money market funds may invest in government securities as well
as certificates of deposit, commercial paper of companies, or other
highly liquid and low-risk securities. These types of money market
funds may include funds that seek to operate as a “retail money
market fund” under applicable regulations. A “retail money market
fund” is a fund that will maintain policies and procedures reasonably
designed to limit all beneficial owners of the fund to natural persons.
Effective October 14, 2016, only “government” and “retail” money
market funds may maintain a stable 1.00 net asset value per share,
and only “government” money market funds can operate without the
possible imposition of a liquidity fee and/or redemption gate.
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. With
respect to a money market fund that qualifies as a “retail” or
“government” money market fund, although the money market fund
seeks to preserve the value of your investment at 1.00 per share,
it cannot guarantee it will do so. In the case of a money market fund
that does not qualify as a “retail” or “government” money market
fund, because the share price of the money market fund will fluctuate,
when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what
you originally paid for them. If a money market fund does not qualify
as a “government” money market fund, effective October 14, 2016,
the money market fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares
or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the money
market fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because
of market conditions or other factors. An investment in a money
market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other
government agency. A money market fund’s sponsor has no legal
obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should
not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund
at any time.
BOND (OR INCOME) FUNDS Generally have higher risks than money
market funds, due to the fact that they typically pursue strategies
aimed at producing higher yields. Unlike money market funds, there
are no laws to restrict bond funds to high-quality or short-term
investments. And because there are many different types of bonds,
these funds can vary dramatically in their risks and rewards. One of
the major risks associated with bond funds is “credit risk,” or the risk
that companies or other issuers may fail to pay their debts. The credit
quality of the bonds contained in a fund will have a direct impact on
their credit risk. Another risk is “interest rate risk,” or the risk that the
market value of the bonds will go down when interest rates increase.
Funds that invest in longer-term bonds tend to have a higher interest
rate risk and fluctuate more dramatically in value. Interest earned on
a bond fund’s portfolio is passed through to investors as dividends,
which may be taken in cash or reinvested. This component of a bond
fund’s earnings (less expenses) is called its yield. The two major
factors that affect a bond fund’s yield are the quality and maturity of
the bonds in the portfolio. In general, lower-quality bonds and those
with longer maturities entail greater risk and generally offer higher
yields. The share price or NAV of a bond fund may change based on
the market value of the bonds in the portfolio. The value of the bonds
in the portfolio may change in response to changes in interest rates.
To calculate the total return of a bond fund, it is necessary to include
the change in share price along with any income earned (dividends
and capital gains distributions).
STOCK (OR EQUITY) FUNDS Typically have higher risks and volatility
than money market and bond funds. However, over the long term,
stocks have historically performed better than any other type of 
investment. “Market risk” is the greatest potential risk for investors in
stock funds. Stock prices can fluctuate dramatically for many reasons,
such as the overall strength of the economy or demand for particular
products or services. Types of stock funds include:
GROWTH FUNDS Focus on stocks (companies) that may not pay
a regular dividend but have the potential for large growth. There
are also different types of growth funds, including small, medium
and large cap funds, which will invest in the stock of these types of
companies.
SECTOR FUNDS May specialize in a particular industry segment,
such as technology or consumer products stocks. A sector fund
concentrates its investments in one sector and involves more risks
than a fund that invests more broadly.
EQUITY INCOME FUNDS Invest in stocks that pay regular dividends.
INDEX FUNDS Seek to achieve the same return as a particular
market index, such as the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index, by
investing in all or many of the companies included in the index. It is
not possible to directly invest in an index.
BALANCED FUNDS Provide investors with a combination of both
stock and bond holdings in one mutual fund.
UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS (UITs) Type of investment company
that buys and holds a generally fixed portfolio of stocks, bonds or
other securities. “Units” in the trust are sold to investors who receive
a share of principal and dividends or interest. UITs have a stated
termination date. Like mutual funds, UITs may charge an initial sales
charge and a deferred sales charge. The UIT’s prospectus contains
information about the portfolio of securities within the UIT and the
sales charges.
EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (ETFs) Type of investment company
that offers investors a proportionate share of a portfolio of stocks,
bonds or other securities. Like individual equity securities, ETFs are
traded on a stock exchange and can be bought and sold throughout
the trading day through a broker-dealer. Many ETFs attempt to track
various stock market sectors, international indices and bond indices.
Recently, additional types of ETFs, including leveraged ETFs and
actively managed ETFs, have been introduced. Since ETFs trade on
an exchange, prices are determined by the prices buyers and sellers
are willing to pay and may not represent the NAV of the underlying
securities or investments. ETFs may trade at a premium or discount
to the NAV.
NON-TRADITIONAL FUNDS Non-traditional funds are mutual
funds or ETFs that pursue alternative investment strategies. While
traditional funds generally focus their investment strategies on longterm buy-and-hold stock and bond investing, non-traditional funds
generally employ more complex trading strategies, such as selling
securities short in anticipation of a drop in their price, using leverage,
and purchasing options and futures. Some non-traditional funds also
focus their investment strategies on investing in gold, commodities
(such as copper and oil) or real assets such as real estate. These
strategies have generally been associated with alternative investment
products such as hedge funds. Additional information, including the
risks associated with investing in non-traditional funds, can be located
at www.jpmorgansecurities.com/NTF.
Running any business involves costs, and mutual fund companies are no exception. Transaction costs, advisory fees,
marketing and distribution expenses (12b-1 fees) are just a few of the costs associated with running a mutual fund.
These costs are passed to investors in the form of fees and expenses. It’s important to clearly understand these fees,
because they will impact your investment returns.
SALES CHARGE (LOAD) Paid when you initially purchase
mutual fund shares. Usually associated with A shares, this charge
is also known as a “front-end load.” A portion of this is usually paid
to the broker selling the shares. Sales charges reduce the amount
of your initial investment, as they are deducted from your initial
investment purchase.
CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE (LOAD) Paid when you
sell mutual fund shares. Usually associated with B or C shares, this
charge is also known as a “back-end load.” The amount will depend on
how long you own the shares, and may decrease to zero if a B share is
held as a long-term investment. May also be paid when selling shares
purchased without a front-end load because the purchase was more
than 1 million dollars.
EXCHANGE FEE Paid when shareholders exchange (transfer) to
another fund within the same fund group.
MANAGEMENT/INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES Paid out of the
fund’s assets to the fund’s Investment Advisor for investment
portfolio management and administrative fees that are not included
in the “Other Expenses” category.
DISTRIBUTION/SERVICE FEES (12B-1 FEES) Paid by the fund from
fund assets to cover the costs of marketing and selling fund shares
and/or to cover the costs of providing shareholder services, such
as advertising, printing and mailing of prospectuses, phone centers
and more. OTHER EXPENSES Expenses not included under “Management/
Investment Advisory Fees” or “Distribution/Service Fees,” such as
custodial expenses, legal and accounting expenses, transfer agent
and administrative expenses.
TOTAL ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES (EXPENSE
RATIO) A line on the fee table that provides the total of a fund’s
annual operating expenses as a percentage of the fund’s average
net assets. Annual operating expenses include the ongoing costs of
running the fund, and the fund company pays these expenses from
the fund’s assets before it distributes any earnings to shareholders.
Included among the annual operating expenses of all mutual funds is
the investment advisory fee, which the fund pays to the Investment
Advisor for managing the portfolio. In some cases, the Investment
Advisor may enter into revenue-sharing arrangements with firms
that distribute the fund. The Investment Advisor finances these
arrangements out of its investment advisory fee and must disclose
the details of such arrangements in the prospectus or Statement of
Additional Information (SAI).
REVENUE SHARING Paid by some funds, their Investment Advisors,
distributors or other entities to brokerage firms, or other distributors
of mutual funds, based on the amount of the fund’s shares sold by the
distributor. In addition to sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the
prospectus, some mutual fund advisors, distributors or other entities
make payments to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) based on the
amount of the fund’s shares sold by JPMS or owned by JPMS’s clients.
The fund prospectus is a valuable tool that will provide you with
information on the various fees. Each fund prospectus is required to
provide a “fee table” near the front of the prospectus that can help
you compare the costs of different funds.
Buying, selling
and exchanging
Mutual fund shares can be purchased and sold on any business day. Mutual funds are priced once each day at a time
specified in the prospectus, usually 4:00 p.m. ET, which is the close of business on the New York Stock Exchange.
When your purchase or sale order is received before the established cut-off time, your transaction will receive the
price calculated for that day.
PURCHASING MUTUAL FUND SHARES When you buy shares, you
pay the current NAV per share plus any fee the fund may assess at the
time of purchase, such as a sales charge or other type of purchase fee.
SELLING MUTUAL FUND SHARES When you sell your shares, the
fund will pay you the current NAV minus any fee the fund assesses at
the time of redemption, such as a deferred (or back-end) sales charge
or redemption fee.
EXCHANGING SHARES Many mutual fund companies have several
different types of funds in which to invest. Most offer exchange
privileges within their family of funds, allowing shareholders to
transfer their holdings from one fund to another within the family,
without incurring an additional sales charge, as their investment
objectives or risk tolerance change.
Exchanges may have tax consequences. Even if the fund doesn’t
charge you for the exchange, you’ll be liable for any gain on the sale
of your original shares or, depending on the circumstances, eligible to
take a loss.
Understanding
share classes
Different share classes provide you with choices for how you wish to pay for your investment. Many mutual funds
make more than one share class available to investors. Each share class invests in the same portfolio of securities and
has the same investment objective and policies; however, each share class has different sales charges and expenses.
This multi-class structure allows investors to select a fee and expense structure that is most appropriate for their
individual investment goals. Here is a brief description and comparison of the share classes commonly available to
individual investors.
CLASS A SHARES In general, Class A shares include a front-end sales
charge (or load) that’s included in the purchase price of the shares
and is determined by the amount you invest. The more you invest, the
lower your purchase cost as a percentage of your investment. Many
mutual fund families offer volume discounts known as “breakpoints,”
based on the amount of investment. Information regarding a mutual
fund’s breakpoints may be found in the prospectus. For long-term
investors, Class A shares generally represent the least costly method
to purchase mutual funds. Class A shares usually have lower 12b-1
fees (annual marketing or distribution fees) than other share classes
offered by the fund. Many mutual funds provide that purchases of
1 million or more of Class A shares will not be subject to a front-end
sales charge. However, the purchaser will incur a deferred or backend sales charge if any of the shares are sold within a specified time
period, generally 12–18 months. In addition, certain investors may
be entitled to a sales charge or load waiver based, for example, on
account type or employment affiliation.
CLASS B SHARES Class B shares usually do not contain front-end
loads, but rather include back-end sales charges or Contingent
Deferred Sales Charges (CDSC). If you sell the shares within a specified
number of years, you pay the sales charge, which usually declines
over time. The 12b-1 fees associated with Class B shares generally are
higher than those imposed on Class A shares. Most fund companies
automatically will convert your Class B shares to Class A shares once
you’ve held the Class B shares for a specified number of years. From
that point forward, you’ll benefit from the lower 12b-1 fees of the Class
A shares. Additionally, higher total fund expenses will result in lower
dividend distributions than Class A shares.
CLASS C SHARES Class C shares generally do not include front-end
sales charges, but they do contain higher 12b-1 fees and may have
a sales charge if you sell within the first year. In addition, 12b-1 fees
never convert to a lower amount, and higher total fund expenses will
result in lower dividend distributions than Class A shares.
MAKING THE MOST OF MUTUAL FUND CLASS A
SHARE DISCOUNT OPPORTUNITIES Mutual funds that charge frontend sales charges, also known as sales loads, may offer a reduced
sales charge when a larger investment is made or may offer sales
charge waivers for certain investors or account types. The investment
levels required to obtain a reduced sales charge are commonly
referred to as “breakpoints.” Each fund company establishes its own
formula for how it will calculate whether an investor is entitled to
receive a breakpoint and establishes its own rules for sales charge
waivers. It’s important to read the prospectus and work with your
Financial Advisor to learn how a particular fund establishes eligibility.
Your Financial Advisor can help you ensure you’re receiving the
correct breakpoint discount or sales charge waiver, or answer any
questions about the sales charges applied to your transactions.
A mutual fund’s breakpoint schedule and waiver eligibility rules
can be found in the fund’s prospectus or Statement of Additional
Information (SAI).
INSTITUTIONAL, RETIREMENT, NO-LOAD AND OTHER SHARE
CLASSES Institutional, retirement, no-load and certain other fund
shares are generally available only through J.P. Morgan Securities’
asset-based fee advisory programs. In these programs, you typically
pay an annual fee based on a percentage of the value of the assets
held in your account, including the value of the fund shares. These
programs provide features and benefits that may not be available in
a traditional brokerage account that charges transaction fees. The
total cost of purchasing and holding mutual fund shares through an
asset-based fee advisory program may be more or less than investing
in mutual fund shares in a traditional J.P. Morgan Securities brokerage
account that is serviced by your Financial Advisor. 
Tax
consequences
Mutual funds have different tax consequences than many other investments. When you purchase and hold mutual
fund shares, you will owe income tax on any ordinary dividends in the year you receive or reinvest them. Additionally,
the law requires mutual funds to distribute capital gains to shareholders when they sell securities for a profit that can’t
be offset by a loss. You may have to pay taxes on the fund’s capital gains for that year even if you still own the shares.
Then, when you sell your shares, you will owe taxes on any capital gain you received on the sale.
When you invest in a tax-exempt fund, such as a municipal bond
fund, some or all of your dividends will be exempt from federal (and
sometimes state and local) income tax. You will, however, owe taxes
on any capital gains realized by the fund and on the sale of your
shares. Anytime you receive a capital gains distribution, you will
usually owe taxes—even if the fund has had a negative return from
the point during the year when you purchased your shares.
Consider contacting the fund to learn when it makes distributions so
you won’t pay more than your fair share of taxes. Mutual funds are
required to disclose after-tax returns in the “Risk/Return Summary”
section of their prospectuses.
We encourage you to consult your tax advisor for more information on
the tax consequences of mutual fund investing.
Sources of
fund information
THE PROSPECTUS When you’re considering the purchase of
mutual fund shares, you should always review the fund’s prospectus
before you invest. The prospectus is the fund’s selling document,
and it contains the following information:
• Fund investment objectives/goals
• Strategies for achieving those goals
• Principal risks of investing in the fund
• Fees and expenses
• Past performance
The prospectus also provides information on the fund’s managers
and Investment Advisors, and describes how to purchase and sell
fund shares. The SEC requires funds to include specific categories of
information in their prospectuses and to present key data (such as
fees and past performance) in a standard format so that investors
can more easily compare different funds.
STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (SAI) The SAI explains
a fund’s operations in greater detail than the prospectus. It includes
the fund’s financial statements and details about the history of the
fund, fund policies on borrowing and concentration, the identity of
officers, directors and persons who control the fund, investment
advisory and other services, brokerage commissions, tax matters
and performance such as yield and average annual total return
information. The mutual fund is typically required to send you an SAI
anytime you request one, and the back cover of a fund’s prospectus
should contain information on how to obtain the SAI.
SHAREHOLDER REPORTS A mutual fund must also provide
shareholders with annual and semiannual reports within 60 days
after the end of the fund’s fiscal year and 60 days after the fund’s
fiscal mid-year. These reports contain a variety of updated financial
information, a list of the fund’s portfolio securities and other
information.
You may obtain any of these documents by:
• Contacting your Financial Advisor
• Calling or writing to the fund
• Visiting the fund’s website
You can obtain additional information about mutual funds at the
educational websites of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(www.SEC.gov), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(www.FINRA.org), the Securities Industry Association (www.SIA.com)
and the Investment Company Institute (www.ICI.org).
Mutual fund glossary
12B-1/DISTRIBUTION FEES Fees paid by the fund out of fund assets
to cover the costs of marketing and selling fund shares and sometimes
to cover the costs of providing shareholder services. “Distribution fees”
include fees to compensate brokers and others who sell fund shares and
to pay for advertising, the printing and mailing of prospectuses to new
investors, and the printing and mailing of sales literature. “Shareholder
Service Fees” are fees paid to persons to respond to investor inquiries
and provide investors with information about their investments.
BREAKPOINTS Mutual funds that charge front-end sales loads may
charge a lower sales load for larger investments. The investment levels
required to obtain a reduced sales load are commonly referred to as
“breakpoints.”
CLASSES Different types of shares issued by a single fund, often
referred to as Class A shares, Class B shares, etc. Each class invests
in the same “pool” (or investment portfolio) of securities and has the
same investment objectives and policies. But each class has different
shareholder services and/or distribution arrangements with different fees
and expenses, and therefore different performance results.
CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE (CDSC) Type of back-end
load, the amount of which depends on the length of time the investor
held his or her shares. For example, a contingent deferred sales load
might be (X)% if an investor holds his or her shares for one year, (X – 1)%
after two years, and so on until the load reaches zero and is eliminated
completely.
EXCHANGES Mutual fund companies may offer exchange privileges
within their family of funds, allowing shareholders to transfer their
holdings from one fund to another within the family.
EXPENSE RATIO Fund’s total annual operating expenses (including
management fees, 12b-1 fees and other expenses) expressed as a
percentage of average net assets.
INVESTMENT ADVISOR/MANAGER Person who manages portfolios
of securities, including mutual funds.
INVESTMENT COMPANY Company (corporation, business trust,
partnership or limited liability company) that issues securities and is
primarily engaged in the business of investing in securities. The three
basic types of investment companies are open-end mutual funds, closedend funds and unit investment trusts (UITs).
LETTER OF INTENT (LOI) Investing an amount greater than
the fund’s breakpoint within a designated period (usually 13 months)
makes you eligible to receive a breakpoint discount on the sales charge as
if the purchases had been made in a single lump sum (some mutual funds
do allow for retroactive LOIs).
MANAGEMENT/ADVISORY FEE Fee paid out of a fund’s assets to
the fund’s Investment Advisor or its affiliates for managing the fund’s
portfolio. Also includes any other management and administrative fees
payable to the fund’s Investment Advisor or its affiliates, and which are
not included in the “Other Expenses” category. A fund’s management fee
appears as a category under “Annual Fund Operating Expenses” in the
Fee Table.
MUTUAL FUND Common name for an open-end investment company.
Like other types of investment companies, mutual funds pool money
from many investors and invest the money in stocks, bonds, short-term
money market instruments or other securities. Mutual funds continuously
issue redeemable shares that investors purchase directly from the fund
(or through a broker for the fund) instead of purchasing from investors on
a secondary market.
NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) Value of the fund’s assets minus its liabilities.
SEC rules require funds to calculate the NAV at least once daily. To
calculate the NAV per share, the fund’s liabilities are subtracted from its
assets and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. NAV is
usually calculated at the close of the New York Stock Exchange (4 p.m. ET).
NO-LOAD FUND Fund that does not charge any type of sales load. Not
every type of shareholder fee is a “sales load,” however, and a no-load
fund may charge fees that are not sales loads. (No-load funds also charge
operating expenses.)
OPERATING EXPENSES Costs a fund incurs in connection with running
the fund, including management fees, 12b-1 fees and other expenses.
PORTFOLIO Individual’s or entity’s combined holdings of stocks, bonds
or other securities and assets.
PROSPECTUS Written document that contains information about
the mutual fund’s costs, investment objectives, risks and performance.
Prospectuses may be obtained from the mutual fund company (through
its website or by phone or mail); your Financial Advisor may also provide
you with a copy.
RELATED ACCOUNTS Used in factoring breakpoint discounts, and
defined differently by each mutual fund, related accounts are those
owned by family members in the same household (i.e., spouse and
minor children).
RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION (ROA) Privilege that allows you to
combine your family’s existing account balances and with new share
purchases to qualify for breakpoint discounts.
RIGHTS OF REINVESTMENT (REINSTATEMENT) Allows clients

Beginning Retirement Planning: Your 20s
At age 25, depending on your household income, your savings should range from 5k for an income of 125,000, up to 210k for an income of 300,000. Note that for a household income of 100,000, it's indicated to see a note suggesting that these households may need to save less than 10%.
Sample Asset Allocation:
Stocks: 80% to 90%
Bonds: 10% to 20%
Even though you may have recently graduated from college and are likely still paying off student loans, use this time to start investing. Whether it’s in a company 401(k) or an individual retirement account (IRA) you set up yourself, invest what you can as a 20-something, even if you can’t contribute the 10% recommended amount.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has established an annual contribution limit for both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs, which is 6,500 in total per year for 2023 and 7,000 for 2024. For 401(k)s, the maximum amount that you can contribute each year is 22,500 in 2023 and 23,000 in 2024.
Some 401(k) plans offer matching contributions from the employer, which means they'll contribute up to a certain percentage of your salary to your 401(k).
You have the biggest advantage over everyone by investing right now: time. Because of compound interest, what you invest during this decade has the greatest possible growth. Since you have more time to absorb changes in the market, you can focus on more aggressive growth stocks and avoid slow-growing assets like bonds.

Career-Focused: Your 30s
By age 30, your savings should range from 35k at 100,000 income to 445k at 300,000 income. At age 35, the amounts increase from 100k for 100,000 income to 735k for 300,000 income.
Savings by age 30: the equivalent of your annual salary saved; if you earn 55,000 per year, by your 30th birthday you should have 55,000 saved
Sample Asset Allocation:
Stocks: 70% to 80%
Bonds: 20% to 30%
If you put off investing in your 20s due to paying off student loans or the fits and starts of establishing your career, your 30s are when you need to start putting money away. You’re still young enough to reap the rewards of compound interest, but old enough to be investing 10% to 15% of your income.
Even if you’re now paying for a mortgage or starting a family, contributing to your retirement should be a top priority. You still have 30 to 40 active working years left, so this is when you need to maximize that contribution. Make sure to put in enough to get the company match in your 401(k) and consider maxing it out if you can. And max out your IRAs, too, while you're at it.
You can still afford some risk, but it may be time to start adding bonds to the mix to have some safety. 

Retirement-Minded: Your 40s
By age 40, if your income is 100,000, you should have 185k saved, increasing to 1,080k if your income is 300,000. At age 45, the savings requirements range from 285k at 100,000 income to 1,495k at 300,000 income.
Savings by age 40: three times your income
Sample Asset Allocation:
Stocks: 60% to 70%
Bonds: 30% to 40%
If you’ve procrastinated saving for retirement until your 40s—or if you were in a low-paying career and switched to something more lucrative—now is the time to buckle down and get serious. If you're already on track, use this time to do serious portfolio building. You’re at the midpoint of your career, and you're probably approaching your peak earning potential.
Even if you’re saving for your kids’ college funds or continuing to pay your mortgage, retirement savings should be at the forefront of every financial decision. You have enough time to play catch up if you’re careful, but not enough time to mess around. Meet with a financial advisor if you’re not sure about which funds to choose. You’ll need to save in aggressive assets like stocks to give your funds the best chance to beat inflation, which is the pace of rising prices in the economy.
However, "aggressive" doesn't mean "careless." Stick with investments that have a track record of producing returns and avoid deals that are "too good to be true." And continue to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs.

Almost Retirement: Your 50s and 60s
By age 50, you should have saved between 395k and 1,955k, depending on your income.
At age 55, the range is from 525k to 2,460k.
By age 60, it is recommended to have between 660k and 3,015k saved.
Finally, at age 65, your savings should be between 755k and 3,365k, based on your income.
Savings by age 50: six times your income
Savings by age 60: eight times your income
Savings by age 67: ten times your income
Sample Asset Allocation:
Stocks: 50% to 60%
Bonds: 40% to 50%
Since you’re getting closer to retirement age, now is not the time to lose focus. If you spent your younger years putting money in the latest hot stocks, you need to be more conservative the closer you get to actually needing your retirement savings.
Switching some of your investments to more stable, low-earning funds like bonds and money markets can be a good choice if you don’t want to risk having all your money on the table. Now is also the time to take note of what you have and start thinking about when might be a good time for you to actually retire. Getting professional advice can be a good step to feeling secure in choosing the right time to walk away.
Another approach is to play catch-up by socking more money away. The IRS allows people approaching retirement to put more of their income into investment accounts. Workers who are 50 and older can contribute an additional 7,500 per year to a 401(k)—called a catch-up contribution—for 2023 and 7,500 for 2024. In other words, those aged 50 and over can add a total of 30,000 to their 401(k) or (22,500 + 7,500) in 2023 and 30,500 or (23,000 + 7,500) in 2024. If you have a traditional or Roth IRA and you're aged 50 or older, the contribution limit is 7,500 for 2023 and 8,000 for 2024.

Retirement: 70s and 80s
Sample Asset Allocation:
Stocks: 30% to 50%
Bonds: 50% to 70%
You're likely retired by now—or will be very soon—so it's time to shift your focus from growth to income. Still, that doesn't mean you want to cash out all your stocks. Focus on stocks that provide dividend income and add to your bond holdings.
At this stage, you'll probably collect Social Security retirement benefits, a company pension (if you have one), and in the year you turn 73 (for those born between 1951 and 1959) or 75 (for those born in 1960 or later), you'll probably start taking required minimum distributions (RMD) from your retirement accounts.
Make sure you take those RMDs on time—there's a 25% penalty on any amount that you should have withdrawn but didn't. If you have a Roth IRA, you don't have to take RMDs, so you can leave the account to grow for your heirs if you don't need the money.
Should you still be working, by the way, you won't owe RMDs on the 401(k) you have at the company where you're employed. And you can still contribute to an IRA (even if it's a traditional one, thanks to the SECURE Act that was passed in late 2019) if you have eligible earned income that doesn't exceed the IRS income thresholds.
The Bottom Line
A Chinese proverb says: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.”
That attitude is at the heart of investing. No matter how old you are, the best time to start investing was a while ago. But it's never too late to do something.
Just make sure the decisions you make are the right ones for your age—your investment approach should age with you. It's also a good idea to meet with a qualified financial professional who can tell you where you stand and where you need to go.

Managing wealth effectively is crucial for high-income earners who want to preserve and grow their assets over time. Here are several strategies that can help in achieving these financial goals:

1. Diversify Investments
Diversification is key to managing risk in any investment portfolio. High-income earners should look to diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.), industries, geographic regions, and investment styles to mitigate risks and maximize returns.

2. Tax Planning
Effective tax planning can significantly increase net income. High-income individuals should work with tax professionals to explore legal avenues for reducing taxable income through tax-loss harvesting, deferring income, and taking advantage of tax-efficient accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s.

3. Retirement Planning
Maximizing contributions to retirement accounts not only provides tax benefits but also secures financial stability in the future. High earners should consider additional retirement vehicles such as SEP IRAs and Solo 401(k)s, especially if they are self-employed or run a small business.

4. Estate Planning
Estate planning is crucial to ensure that wealth is transferred according to one’s wishes while minimizing estate taxes. This involves setting up trusts, wills, and health care directives. Regularly updating these documents is important as personal circumstances and tax laws change.

5. Debt Management
High income does not necessarily mean low debt. Managing debt effectively, such as choosing low-interest options and prioritizing the repayment of high-interest debts, is essential. Using debt strategically can also enhance portfolio growth, for instance through leveraging.

6. Emergency Fund
Maintaining a robust emergency fund is advisable to cover unexpected expenses without needing to liquidate investments at an inopportune time. A common recommendation is to have 6 to 12 months’ worth of living expenses in a highly liquid form.

7. Invest in Yourself
Investing in further education or professional development can lead to higher earnings potential and job security. High-income earners should consider continuous learning as part of their wealth management strategy.

8. Charitable Giving
Charitable contributions can reduce taxable income and fulfill personal philanthropic goals. Setting up a donor-advised fund or a private foundation can be effective ways for high-income earners to manage their charitable giving.

9. Insurance Planning
Adequate insurance coverage—life, disability, and liability—helps protect against unforeseen personal and financial risks. Evaluating insurance needs regularly and adjusting coverage as circumstances change is vital.

10. Work with Professionals
Financial advisors, tax professionals, and estate planners can provide valuable advice tailored to individual financial situations. For high-income earners, the complexity of financial decisions often necessitates professional guidance.

11. Real Estate Investments
Real estate can be a valuable part of a diversified investment portfolio, offering both income through rentals and potential capital appreciation. However, it's important to evaluate real estate investments within the context of local market conditions and overall investment goals.

Implementing these strategies requires careful planning and ongoing management. Each individual’s financial situation is unique, and strategies should be tailored to personal goals, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances.
